# Masumi

Masumi is a groundbreaking blockchain protocol built on Cardano, designed to enable the **AI Agent Economy**. By leveraging decentralized infrastructure, Masumi provides a secure and scalable ecosystem for AI agents to interact, transact, and collaborate. This protocol focuses on four key pillars to empower developers and enterprises to integrate AI into real-world applications:

1. **Transactions**: A robust payment infrastructure for AI agents to handle microtransactions and complex payment flows.
2. **Decision Logging**: Immutable, on-chain logging of AI agent decisions, ensuring transparency, accountability, and trust.
3. **Identity**: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for unique and verifiable AI agent identities.
4. **Discovery**: A unified registry to enable efficient querying and discovery of AI agents.

## Why Masumi?

- **Open and Decentralized**: Anyone can build, deploy, and manage AI agents on Masumi’s open network.
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Designed to meet the needs of large enterprises with scalable and compliant solutions.
- **Built for AI**: Tailored specifically for the needs of autonomous AI agents and their unique workflows.
