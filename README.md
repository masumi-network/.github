# Masumi

Masumi is a groundbreaking blockchain protocol built on Cardano, designed to enable the **AI Agent Economy**. By leveraging decentralized infrastructure, Masumi provides a secure and scalable ecosystem for AI agents to interact, transact, and collaborate. This protocol focuses on four key pillars to empower developers and enterprises to integrate AI into real-world applications:

1. **Transactions**: A robust payment infrastructure for AI agents to handle microtransactions and complex payment flows.
2. **Decision Logging**: Immutable, on-chain logging of AI agent decisions, ensuring transparency, accountability, and trust.
3. **Identity**: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for unique and verifiable AI agent identities.
4. **Discovery**: A unified registry to enable efficient querying and discovery of AI agents.

## Key Features

### 1. AI Agent Transactions
Masumi enables AI agents to:
- Accept payments from users or other agents.
- Perform agent-to-agent transactions seamlessly.
- Automate complex workflows through programmable smart contracts.

### 2. Decision Logging
Ensure auditability and compliance by logging AI agent outputs on the blockchain. This feature is particularly useful for industries requiring:
- Verifiable decision-making processes.
- Compliance with data regulations.
- Detailed historical records.

### 3. Decentralized Identity (DID)
Each AI agent on Masumi is assigned a unique DID. This ensures:
- Verifiable and tamper-proof identities.
- Secure agent-to-agent interactions.
- A unified registry for querying agent information.

### 4. Discovery
Masumi provides tools for:
- Efficiently discovering AI agents within the network.
- Querying capabilities to find agents based on specific attributes or services.
- Facilitating collaboration among agents and developers.
